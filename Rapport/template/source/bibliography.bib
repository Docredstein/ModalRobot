abstract = {Mobile robot path planning refers to the design of the safely collision-free path with shortest distance and least time-consuming from the starting point to the end point by a mobile robot autonomously. In this paper, a systematic review of mobile robot path planning techniques is presented. Firstly, path planning is classified into global path planning and local path planning according to the mastery of environmental information. In the global path planning, environment modeling methods and path evaluation method are introduced. The methods of environment modeling include grid method, topology method, geometric feature method and mixed representation method. In the local path planning, we introduce the sensors commonly used in the detection environment, including laser radar and visual sensor. Next, according to the characteristics of algorithms, mobile robot path planning algorithms are divided into three categories: classical algorithms, bionic algorithms and artificial intelligence algorithms. Among the classical algorithms, we introduce the cell decomposition method, sampling based method, graph search algorithm, artificial potential field method and dynamic window method. In the algorithm based on bionics, we introduce genetic algorithm, ant colony algorithm, gray wolf algorithm, etc. in detail. In artificial intelligence algorithm, we introduce neural network algorithm and fuzzy logic. Finally, we compare the key technologies of mobile robot path planning in the form of graphs and charts based on the classification statistics of the collected literature to provide references for future research.}
